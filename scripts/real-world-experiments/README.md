### This section is for reproducing the real world experiments.

These experiments require first downloading the data. To do this call:

``` $ python path-to-feature-shift/scripts/real-world-experiments/fetch-data.py ARGUMENT```

Where ARGUMENT can be either: all, gas, energy, or covid.
E.g. to download all datasets use, `$ python feature-shift/scripts/real-world-experiments/fetch-data.py all`

*Note: Due to licencing issues, we are not able to share the COVID dataset in this manner. Please get in touch with the author using the email 
on the main page to request access to this dataset. Thank you.*
